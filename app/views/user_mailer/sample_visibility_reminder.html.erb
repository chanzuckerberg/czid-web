<p>Hi <%= @name %>,</p>

<p>We’re reminding you that you have samples in CZ ID that will become visible to other users in <b><%= @period_name %></b>:</p>

<p>
  <% @projects.each do |proj| %>
    <% sample_count = @samples_by_project_id[proj.id].size %>
    <% project_link = "#{root_url}my_data?projectId=#{proj.id}" %>
    • <%= sample_count %> samples in project <a href="<%= project_link %>"><%= proj.name %></a><br />
  <% end %>
</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please refer to our <a href="https://czid.org/privacy">privacy policy</a> or contact us directly at <a href="mailto:help@czid.org">help@czid.org</a>.</p>

---

<p>Your samples become visible to other CZ ID users, or “public”, 1 year after the original upload date. Public samples help enrich the experience for you and other researchers. For instance, it allows you to compare your samples with samples collected around the world using tools like the heatmap.</p>

<p>Raw Sample Data (FASTA/FASTQ) is never shared with any other CZ ID user, nor is it ever accessed by anyone working on CZ ID unless specifically requested by a user, such as to debug an issue.</p>

<p>
  Thanks,<br /> The CZ ID Team
