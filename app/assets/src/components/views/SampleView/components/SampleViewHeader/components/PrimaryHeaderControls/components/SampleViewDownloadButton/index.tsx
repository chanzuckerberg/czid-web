import { SampleViewDownloadButton } from "./SampleViewDownloadButton";

/*
 NOTE: component code should go in SampleViewDownloadButton.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { SampleViewDownloadButton } from .../SampleViewDownloadButton
 rather than
 import { SampleViewDownloadButton } from .../SampleViewDownloadButton/SampleViewDownloadButton.tsx
