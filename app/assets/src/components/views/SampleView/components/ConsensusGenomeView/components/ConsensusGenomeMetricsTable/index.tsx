 NOTE: component code should go in ConsensusGenomeMetricsTable.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { ConsensusGenomeMetricsTable } from .../ConsensusGenomeMetricsTable
 rather than
 import { ConsensusGenomeMetricsTable } from .../ConsensusGenomeMetricsTable/ConsensusGenomeMetricsTable.tsx
