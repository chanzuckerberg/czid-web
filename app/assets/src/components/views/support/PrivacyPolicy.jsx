        <h3>About IDseq</h3>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          IDseq is an online platform designed to enable the research community
          to research pathogens in metagenomic sequencing and to help further
          the study of infectious diseases. To do this, IDseq processes genetic
          data in order to identify pathogens contained within.
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          <b>Here’s how IDseq works</b>: Users submit Upload Data (as described
          below). This data may contain human and non-human genetic sequences (“<b
          >
            Sample Data
          </b>”; as further defined below), as well as information about those
          sequences, such as the date the sample was collected and the species
          it was collected from (“<b>Sample Metadata</b>” as further defined
          below). For example, a researcher might upload genetic information
          from mosquitoes, which are often a source of infectious disease, or
          from humans, who can be infected by such diseases. IDseq then
          processes this Upload Data in order to identify pathogens found within
          the genetic sequence (e.g., the mosquito may be carrying the
          chikungunya virus).
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          We hope that this sharing of pathogen data will help to create a
          global dashboard that helps researchers better understand pathogens.
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          IDseq also collects information about Users in order to offer the
          Service. Other than basic information required to create an account
          (e.g. email address, name), the User determines what information they
          want to upload onto IDseq. Please note: IDseq is not designed for or
          directed toward children under the age of sixteen.

          “<b>Upload Data</b>” is data that Users upload to IDseq (other than
          the information Users provide during registration to create an
          account). As explained below, Upload Data consists of genetic sequence
          information (human or non-human) and metadata about those genetic
          sequences (such as time and location of sample collection).
        </p>

            “<b>Sample Data</b>” is full genetic sequence data uploaded by
            Users. Genetic sequence data contains genetic information about
            pathogens in the sample and of the host from which the sample was
            taken. The host could be a human or non-human (e.g., mosquito). You
            should not be able to find any human sequence data in IDseq other
            than those embedded in samples you yourself have uploaded. This is
            because we filter out and discard host sequence data in order to

          Sample Data and Sample Metadata are shared back to the Users that
          uploaded the data, as well as other IDseq users with whom they
          expressly choose to share that information. Users can share the Sample
          Data and Metadata they submit by creating Projects (groups of Samples
          and Reports) and sharing those Projects with other IDseq users, who
          will then be able to see and download the Sample Data that was shared
          with them.
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          Please note that in order to advance IDseq’s goal of creating a global
          pathogen dashboard for researchers, Sample Metadata and Report Data
          (described below) will be made available to Users outside of a
          Project.{" "}

        <p className={cs.large}>
          To the extent that the European Union’s General Data Protection
          Regulation (“GDPR”) applies, we rely on the following legal bases to
          use and share personal data within Upload Data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The explicit consent of the individual whose data is being analyzed,
            where such consent has been obtained by the User in accordance with
            the GDPR; and
          </li>
          <li>
            The public interest and our and our Users’ legitimate interest in
            investigating and stopping the spread of infectious diseases and
            promoting global health. The use and sharing of personal data within
            Upload Data furthers the public interest in the area of public
            health, particularly by helping to protect against serious
            cross-border threats to health. The processing of personal data
            within Upload Data is also necessary for scientific research
            purposes.

        <h2>
          <span className={cs.number}>2.</span>Report Data.
        </h2>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          Report Data is information IDseq produced from Upload Data. We
          generate Report Data by processing Upload Data through our Data
          Pipeline. The “<b>Data Pipeline</b>” cleans (e.g., by removing
          duplicate nucleotides) and analyzes (e.g., by matching Sample Data
          nucleotide sequences with known pathogen sequences) the Upload Data.
          Report Data may include, for example, data about the pathogen
          sequences identified in the Sample Data and the frequency of such
          identification (“<b>Pathogen Data</b>”) or raw numeric counts of
          non-personally identifying gene expression profiles that were found in
          the Sample Data (“<b>Gene Counts</b>”).
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          Once Sample Data has been put through the Data Pipeline, the Report
          Data that is produced no longer includes any human genetic sequence
          data, and is not personal data, and does not, on its own, permit
          association with any specific individual. You should not be able to
          find any human sequence data in IDseq other than those embedded in
          samples you yourself have uploaded. This is because we filter out and
          remove host sequence data in order to generate Reports. If you are
          able to find human sequence data elsewhere in IDseq, please let us
          know at <a href="mailto:privacy@idseq.net">privacy@idseq.net</a> and

          If you are a User, you have the following choices:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users are able to request the deletion of User Data that constitutes
            their personal data or Sample Data that they submitted to IDseq.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users are able to access and download Report Data relating to Upload
            Data they submitted within IDseq.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users may also object to the processing of User Data in certain
            circumstances by emailing{" "}
            <a href="mailto:privacy@idseq.net">privacy@idseq.net</a>. In such
            cases, we will stop processing that data unless we have legitimate
            grounds to continue processing it -- for example, it is needed for
            legal reasons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users can also contact us by emailing{" "}
            <a href="mailto:privacy@idseq.net">privacy@idseq.net</a> should they
            wish to access, restrict the processing of, or rectify their User
            Data.

          If a User has submitted Upload Data containing your personal data,

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We require Users who submit Upload Data to ensure they have all
            necessary consents, permissions, and authorizations to do so. We are
            unable to relate Upload Data to identifiable individuals and so
            cannot directly process requests from persons whose personal
            sequencing data may be contained in Upload Data. As a result, IDseq
            is able to receive access, restriction, rectification, objection, or
            deletion requests only from Users.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you believe your information has been uploaded to IDseq, you
            should contact the researcher or User that uploaded this information
            to (i) request access to the information, (ii) object to the
            processing of the information, or (iii) seek deletion, restriction,
            or rectification of the information. Similarly, if you previously
            provided consent to a researcher or User, you may have the right to
            withdraw that consent. You should contact the researcher or User to
            make such a withdrawal or otherwise exercise your rights.
