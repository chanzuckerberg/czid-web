        <h3>About IDseq</h3>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          IDseq is an online platform designed to enable the research community
          to research pathogens in metagenomic sequencing and to help further
          the study of infectious diseases. To do this, IDseq processes genetic
          data in order to identify pathogens contained within.
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          <b>Here&#39;s how IDseq works</b>: Users submit Upload Data (as
          described below). This data may contain human and non-human genetic
          sequences (“<b>Sample Data</b>”; as further defined below), as well as
          information about those sequences, such as the date the sample was
          collected and the species it was collected from (“<b>
            Sample Metadata
          </b>” as further defined below). For example, a researcher might
          upload genetic information from mosquitoes, which are often a source
          of infectious disease, or from humans, who can be infected by such
          diseases. IDseq then processes this Upload Data in order to identify
          pathogens found within the genetic sequence (e.g., the mosquito may be
          carrying the chikungunya virus).
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          “<b>Upload Data</b>” is data that Users upload to IDseq (other than
          the information Users provide during registration to create an
          account). Upload Data consists of genetic sequence information (human
          or non-human) and metadata about those genetic sequences (such as time
          and location of sample collection). Upload Data includes Sample Data
          and Sample Metadata.
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          “<b>Sample Data</b>” is full genetic sequence data uploaded by Users.
          Genetic sequence data contains genetic information about pathogens in
          the sample and of the host from which the sample was taken. The host
          could be a human or non-human (e.g., mosquito). You should not be able
          to find any human sequence data in IDseq other than those embedded in
          samples you yourself have uploaded. This is because we filter out and
          discard host sequence data in order to generate Reports.
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          “<b>Sample Metadata</b>” includes information related to the Sample
          Data, such as the host type (e.g., human or mosquito), upload date,
          and tissue type and free-text research notes entered by Users. This
          data <u>should not</u> include personally-identifying information
          regarding the individual to whom the Sample Data relates.
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          “<b>Report Data</b>” is information IDseq produced from Upload Data.
          We generate Report Data by processing Upload Data through our Data
          Pipeline. IDseq’s “<b>Data Pipeline</b>” cleans (e.g., by removing
          duplicate nucleotides) and analyzes (e.g., by matching Sample Data
          nucleotide sequences with known pathogen sequences) the Upload Data.
          Report Data may include, for example, data about the pathogen
          sequences identified in the Sample Data and the frequency of such
          identification (“<b>Pathogen Data</b>”) or raw numeric counts of
          non-personally identifying gene expression profiles that were found in
          the Sample Data (“<b>Gene Counts</b>”).
        </p>
        <p className={cs.large}>
          “<b>Database</b>” refers to both the data and database(s) of IDseq.
