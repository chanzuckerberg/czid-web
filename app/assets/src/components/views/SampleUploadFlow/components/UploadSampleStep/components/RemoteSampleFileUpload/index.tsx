 NOTE: component code should go in RemoteSampleFileUpload.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { RemoteSampleFileUpload } from .../RemoteSampleFileUpload
 rather than
 import { RemoteSampleFileUpload } from .../RemoteSampleFileUpload/RemoteSampleFileUpload.tsx
