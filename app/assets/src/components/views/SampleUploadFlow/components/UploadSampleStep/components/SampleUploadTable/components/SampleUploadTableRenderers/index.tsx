 NOTE: component code should go in SampleUploadTableRenderers.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { SampleUploadTableRenderers } from .../SampleUploadTableRenderers
 rather than
 import { SampleUploadTableRenderers } from .../SampleUploadTableRenderers/SampleUploadTableRenderers.tsx
