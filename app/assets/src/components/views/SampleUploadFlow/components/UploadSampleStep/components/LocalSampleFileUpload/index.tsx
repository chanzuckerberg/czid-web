 NOTE: component code should go in LocalSampleFileUpload.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { LocalSampleFileUpload } from .../LocalSampleFileUpload
 rather than
 import { LocalSampleFileUpload } from .../LocalSampleFileUpload/LocalSampleFileUpload.tsx
