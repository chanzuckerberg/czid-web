import { SampleUploadFlowHeader } from "./SampleUploadFlowHeader";

/*
 NOTE: component code should go in SampleUploadFlowHeader.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { SampleUploadFlowHeader } from .../SampleUploadFlowHeader
 rather than
 import { SampleUploadFlowHeader } from .../SampleUploadFlowHeader/SampleUploadFlowHeader.tsx
