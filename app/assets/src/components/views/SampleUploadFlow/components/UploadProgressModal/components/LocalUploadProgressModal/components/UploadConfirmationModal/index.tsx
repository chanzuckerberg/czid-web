 NOTE: component code should go in UploadConfirmationModal.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { UploadConfirmationModal } from .../UploadConfirmationModal
 rather than
 import { UploadConfirmationModal } from .../UploadConfirmationModal/UploadConfirmationModal.tsx
