/*
 NOTE: component code should go in LocalUploadProgressModal.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { LocalUploadProgressModal } from .../LocalUploadProgressModal
 rather than
 import { LocalUploadProgressModal } from .../LocalUploadProgressModal/LocalUploadProgressModal.tsx
