/*
 NOTE: component code should go in RemoteUploadProgressModal.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { RemoteUploadProgressModal } from .../RemoteUploadProgressModal
 rather than
 import { RemoteUploadProgressModal } from .../RemoteUploadProgressModal/RemoteUploadProgressModal.tsx
