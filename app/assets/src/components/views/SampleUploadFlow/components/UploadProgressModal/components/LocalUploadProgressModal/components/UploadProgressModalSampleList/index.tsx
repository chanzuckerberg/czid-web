/*
 NOTE: component code should go in UploadProgressModalSampleList.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { UploadProgressModalSampleList } from .../UploadProgressModalSampleList
 rather than
 import { UploadProgressModalSampleList } from .../UploadProgressModalSampleList/UploadProgressModalSampleList.tsx
