    summary: `From 2017-19, 8.5% of all deaths among Indigenous community members in Brazil did not have a registered cause — which is double the proportion observed in the non-Indigenous population. Many of Brazil’s Indigenous communities live in close proximity to wild and domestic animals and in precarious circumstances with food insecurity and limited access to sanitation. These challenges create an optimal environment for transmission of infectious diseases and for potential co-infections. Additionally, Indigenous patients rarely receive a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis, leading to increasing numbers of avoidable deaths. This project will leverage metagenomics and CZ ID to identify pathogens and co-infections and strengthen clinical diagnostic pathways.

Every year, around 10.6 million cases and 288,000 deaths are reported globally, and more than half occur below the Sahara in a region called the African Meningitis Belt (AMB). Since national disease surveillance only focuses on the detection of four main meningitis pathogens by PCR (meningococcus, streptococcus, GBS and haemophilus influenzae), other causative pathogens are detected in less than 20% of cerebral spinal fluid samples. This study will use CZ ID to determine etiology and will build a collaboration between Swiss Centre for Scientifique Research, the National Meningitis Reference Laboratory in Côte d’Ivoire, the Centre for Vaccine Development in Mali, and the National Institute of Public Health in Guinea.

Although PCR is currently the gold standard for diagnosing VHF viruses, viral genetic diversity (for example, amongst Lassa virus lineages) and the accumulation of mutations can hinder test sensitivity and impact swift responses to future outbreaks. In addition, the current molecular blood-borne pathogen testing algorithm lacks testing for other relevant outbreak-prone viruses and bacterial pathogens with epidemic potential. This team will use metagenomic sequencing with CZ ID to overcome the challenges with  current methods and complement ongoing national VHF disease surveillance activities for the early detection of outbreaks.
