 NOTE: component code should go in FilterButtonWithCounter.tsx
 This index file is here so our imports are cleaner.
 This way we can use
 import { FilterButtonWithCounter } from .../FilterButtonWithCounter
 rather than
 import { FilterButtonWithCounter } from .../FilterButtonWithCounter/FilterButtonWithCounter.tsx
