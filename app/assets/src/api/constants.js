// Event name guidelines:
// Follow object_action convention with object being the name of the core model or component name
// if it makes sense. Keep names meaningful, descriptive, and non-redundant (e.g. prefer sample_view
// to sample_view_view).
// ANALYTICS_EVENT_NAMES will have the camelCase key and snake_case value.

export const ANALYTICS_EVENT_NAMES = {
  sampleView: "sample_view"
};
